# Recycle

A quick little gem for managing shortcuts for navigation and quick little helper
functions.  Often dot files can be frustrating to manage, this aims to remove
some of the frustration by adding an easy way of adding directory shortcuts
(through aliases) and helper functions for commands.

To use:

* install the gem
* run the command `recycle init`
* add the following to your shell
```sh
eval "$(recycle exec)"
```

This is still very much a work in progress, but give it a shot and open up pull
requests as you see fit.
